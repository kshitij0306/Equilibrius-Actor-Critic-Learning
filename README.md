# Equilibrius: The Art of Actor-Critic Learning

## Overview
"Equilibrius: The Art of Actor-Critic Learning" is a Reinforcement Learning project that delves into the sophisticated Actor-Critic algorithm with Eligibility Traces. This repository presents a comprehensive implementation and evaluation, focusing on the Cart-Pole challenge to demonstrate advanced RL techniques.

## Key Components
- `ActorCriticWithET.py`: The core Python script featuring the implementation of the Actor-Critic algorithm with Eligibility Traces.
- `Experiment.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook providing a detailed evaluation and analysis of the algorithm's performance in the Cart-Pole environment.
